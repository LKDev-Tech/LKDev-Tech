<summary><h2>˜”*°•.˜”*°• About Me Professionally •°*”˜.•°*”˜</h2></summary> 
<p>
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kevin Lam. Enjoy your stay~<br>
I'm a Full-stack developer graduated from a 3-year college program, 2 years of professional experience and almost 3 years of freelance experience with an eye for ethical hacking, game development and software development. If I had to rank my interests, it would be:<br>  
1. Cybersecurity<br>
2. Game Development<br>
3. Software Development<br>
This list is not set in stone and what I like changes from time to time. I like all 3 of them still.
Content creation is also part of my plans and possibly other things that I have floating in my head. There's a lot going through my thoughts about projects, so right now it's more of a sorting them out. As of now, I am focused on learning and developing more with the help of Udemy courses. Currently job seeking/Freelancing.</p>

<h3 align="center">˜”*°•.˜”*°• 🧰 Languages, Frameworks and Tools •°*”˜.•°*”˜</h3>
*Note: some of the images link to where I learned about the language or tool. Those with no links are what I learned in College or from a YouTube tutorial and just have a tooltip when you hover over them. I don't remember all of the tutorials I've watched, so some just aren't linked and have an explanation instead.
